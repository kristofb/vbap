VBAP &amp; Define Loudspeaker from Ville Pulkki - updated and adapted by Christophe B.

Help files are quite old.

Code is up to date, and corrects crashes. You'll find them in commit history.

OSX build project is up to date, however some destination folders may point to my filesystem.

Windows build projects may be outdated as I use another build chain for Windows.
